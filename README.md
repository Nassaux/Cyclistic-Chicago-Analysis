Cyclistic case study for Google Analytics Certification

 Overview:

 This analysis explores how Casual Riders and Annual Members use Cyclistic’s bike
sharing service differently.

 The Problem:

 Cyclistic wants to increase annual memberships but currently lacks insight into how 
Casual Riders use the service differently. Without this understanding, it's difficult to 
design strategies that encourage casual users to commit long-term.
 
  The Solution:
 
This analysis reveals key behavioral differences between Casual Riders and Annual 
Members—such as trip duration, timing, bike type, and preferred locations. These 
insights can guide targeted offers and campaigns designed to convert casual users 
into committed annual members.


Tools used:

Initially, I planned to follow guidelines and use Excel, SQL & Tableau. However, since files were too big for each of the programs I wanted to use, I switched to PowerBI, which allowed me to merge, transform, manipulate and visualize data with no limitation.
 

 Details:
 
 The analysis draws from 12 months of ride data (March 2024–February 2025), covering over 4 million rides. 
- Annual members represent 64% of total rides vs 36% for Casuals
- Trip Duration: Casual Riders average 50% more ride time than Members
- Ride Timing: Casuals ride more on weekends and Members during weekday commutes
- Seasonality: Rides peak in summer and drop significantly in winter
- Bike Type: Electric bike usage is growing, especially among Casuals
- Location: Casual rides cluster in leisure areas and Southside. Members dominate downtown and most residential zones

 Reflections & Next Steps:
 
- Launch campaigns in peak seasons (spring/summer weekends) to convert Casuals
- Test promotions like discounted upgrades for high-frequency casual users
- Target Southside casuals riding early mornings—potential commuters
- Segment messaging by location and time of day for personalized outreach
